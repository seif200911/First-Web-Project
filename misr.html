            <th>As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the study of celestial bodies by applying the laws of
                physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
                physica, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics,
                which will be crucial for the holistic understanding of the subject matter.</th>

                Planetary research today is a strongly multidisciplinary endeavor with efforts coming from engineering
                and natural sciences. This book provides an up-to-date interdisciplinary geoscience-focused overview of
                solid solar system bodies and their evolution, based on the comparative description of processes acting
                on them.

                In writing this textbook the author's objective was to provide students with a non-trivial, reasonably
                priced introduction to astronomy. Starting with problems astronomers face on Earth connected with
                observation, the book then moves on to cover the Solar System, galaxies and finally cosmology.
